# Custom Data Provider

When using an uncontrolled environment, you need to provide your data by supplying a data provider.
This provider must implement the [TreeDataProvider interface](/docs/api/interfaces/TreeDataProvider), i.e.

```typescript
export interface TreeDataProvider<T = any> {
  onDidChangeTreeData?: (listener: (changedItemIds: TreeItemIndex[]) => void) => Disposable;
  getTreeItem: (itemId: TreeItemIndex) => Promise<TreeItem<T>>;
  getTreeItems?: (itemIds: TreeItemIndex[]) => Promise<TreeItem[]>;
  onRenameItem?: (item: TreeItem<T>, name: string) => Promise<void>;
  onChangeItemChildren?: (itemId: TreeItemIndex, newChildren: TreeItemIndex[]) => Promise<void>;
}
```

At least the `getTreeItem` method must be implemented, to declare how data can be made available
to the tree structure. `getTreeItems` allows you to make loading more efficient if multiple entries
need to be loaded at once. If you do not implement `getTreeItems`, they are loaded sequentially
using `getTreeItem`.

The methods `onRenameItem` and `onChangeItemChildren` allow you to declare how updates to the
tree structure should be handled, i.e. by renaming an item or moving items from one parent to
another. You still need to enable this functionality in the environment by providing the respective
flags. Look into the [TreeCapabilities interface](/docs/api/interfaces/treecapabilities) for more details
on the necessary flags.
