# Search Functionality

Searching for items is natively supported. It looks through all items that are curretly visible in the
tree, similar to how other tree implementations do it such as the tree view in IntelliJ or VsCode. Search
is automatically started if the tree is focused and the user starts typing.

This also implements the accessibility feature where entering a single character while focusing the tree
should move the focus to the first item that matches the character. See the
[W3C spec for keyboard bindings](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/treeview/treeview-2/treeview-2a.html#kbd_label)
for more details.

:::info
All props that can be provided to the tree environment to control search capabilities are documented
in the [TreeCapabilities interface](/docs/api/interfaces/treecapabilities).
:::

:::warning
(TODO) Apparently the search currently does not work properly in the docs pages, where the search input
is not properly shown. Working examples are available in the storybook.
:::

## Example

Try focusing the tree (i.e. by clicking on it) and start typing to search.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{
        'tree-1': {
          expandedItems: ['Fruit', 'Meals'],
        },
      }}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-1" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

## Configurability

The prop `canSearchByStartingTyping` manages whether the search can be initiated by just starting to type
while focusing the tree. In the following example, the hotkey `F1` needs to be pressed to start search.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{
        'tree-2': {
          expandedItems: ['Fruit', 'Meals'],
        },
      }}
      canSearchByStartingTyping={false}
      keyboardBindings={{
        startSearch: ['f1'],
      }}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-2" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```

Search can also be disabled completely by setting the prop `canSearch` to false.

```jsx live
function App() {
  return (
    <UncontrolledTreeEnvironment
      dataProvider={new StaticTreeDataProvider(longTree.items, (item, data) => ({ ...item, data }))}
      getItemTitle={item => item.data}
      viewState={{
        'tree-3': {
          expandedItems: ['Fruit', 'Meals'],
        },
      }}
      canSearch={false}
    >
      <Tree treeId="tree-3" rootItem="root" treeLabel="Tree Example" />
    </UncontrolledTreeEnvironment>
  );
}
```
